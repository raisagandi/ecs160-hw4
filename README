NOTE: we need to submit ONLY one file!
I'm creating a Makefile just for ease of programming, we'll need to put the dictionary logic in maxTweeter.c

The executable name is "max"
So to test it, type on the console: "max <csv_file_name>"

Again, we'll remove the makefile and dictionary files later.

Testing TODO:
1. If file is invalid, exit(1) [ ]
2. Check if the first argument is the csv file. [ ]
3. Check that : if the name header is surrounded by quotes, ALL the tweeter names should be surrounded by quotes.
   If not, file is invalid [ ]
4. A valid file should NOT have duplicate headers [ ]
